Overview:

This project will explore and test our knowledge of rigid retaining walls. The main focus of this code is to allow for geotechnical external stability checks to be performed for a CIP rigid cantilever retaining structure. Users will be able to input wall geometry and soil properties to test for a wider variety of scenarios. Additionally, this project will help the user determine a factor of safety for their project. This project will also provide a plot of the lateral earth pressure diagram associated with their inputted retaining wall scenario.

Unless otherwise stated, this code does make the following assumptions that are important to note:
1. The backfill behind the wall is horizontal
2. There is no pore water pressure acting on the wall
3. The soil is cohesionless
4. The soil-wall interface is vertical
5. The soil moves on a planar failure surface
6. The resultant force is angled parallel to the backfill surface
