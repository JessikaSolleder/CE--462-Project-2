Overview:

This program allows users to input a variety of parameters (see list below) as it related to their specific Cast-in-Place (C.I.P.) rigid cantilever retaining structure. The purpose of this program is to conduct geotechnical external stability checks, determine an appropriate factor of safety and produce a lateral earth pressure diagram for these structures.

Unless otherwise stated, this code does make the following assumptions that are important to note:

1. There is no pore water pressure acting on the wall
2. The soil is cohesionless
3. The soil-wall interface is vertical
4. The soil moves on a planar failure surface
5. The resultant force is angled parallel to the backfill surface
6. The soil is homogenous (one layer, no backfill)
7. Interface friction (Sigma) is equal to the slop of the backfill (Alpha)
8. Counterclockwise Moments are positive
   
Users will be able to input values for the following parameters:

1. The Height of the rigid retaining wall (H)
2. The unit weight of the soil behind the wall (Gamma)
3. The angle of internal friction (Phi ')
4. The angle of the backfill in relation to the top of the retaining wall (Alpha)
* To enhance user experience all angles are requested in degrees and are then converted to radians by the program
